KickPunch is an old school Beat-'em-up game. Get your fighting skills tested by defeating all enemies in this three level action game.

It's a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Brian and Gloria Freezby are back in their home town for the weekend and are taking a stroll on Shaker St. together with their dog Dido. Suddenly, they are approached by a group of hooligans. One of them, visibly bigger than the others, steps out of the group. It's Brianâ€™s old rival - Arkian Joel. Arkian does some smack talk and orders a bunch of his thugs to grab Gloria and Dido. He then leaves his gang to take care of the *Brian problem*.

Brian faces the bad guys in fight and after defeating them continues down on Shaker St. determined to find Arkian and save his wife and dog.

# Controls

It's time to kick ass and chew bubble gum. :fist:

Ok, ok. There's no bubble gum in this game, ...yet! :smiling_imp:

  * :video_game: *Use the Gamepad Luke!* No seriously, the game can be played with a gamepad (xinput), so go ahead and try it.
  * :running: `D-Pad`, `Left Stick`, `Arrow Keys` or `WASD` keys to move.
  * :facepunch: Press `X (xbox)`, `H`, `O` or `Enter` to punch.
  * :rage3: Press `A (xbox)`, `J`, `P` or `Backspace` to kick.

Here are some hints.

  * Move, move, move. Don't let the enemies surround you. Try to stack them together and then hit them.
  * Kicks knock enemies back farther than punches, but they do less damage.
  * Get food to heal yourself. The bigger the dish, the more hitpoints you'll get restored. Also, make sure you look behind the objects in each level.
